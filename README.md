# Handwriting-recognition
- Handwriting Recognition Using NUMPY 
- This is an exercise using multiple neurons. Assuming that we only have 0, 1, and 2 to identify, then there must be 3 neural network outputs. If it is 0, output [1,0,0], and if it is 1, output [0,1,0], if it is 2, output [0,0,1].
- Through the basic theory of neural network, we can know that adding Hidden layer can help the learning process. This exercise only adds one layer to try.
